# MAVIS

MAVIS is an educational experiment to learn more about C#, WPF and the MVVM pattern.

This code contains a very simple, and not very well styled, application which shows how the navigation can be achieved and how dialogs can be shown
(both simple ones like a MessageBox-like implemention and a more complex version which allows a ViewModel to be set).

The [wiki](https://github.com/RichyL/MAVIS/wiki) has a deeper explanation of the project.
